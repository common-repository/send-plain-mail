== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are my recipients not receiving my emails? =
Try installing a WordPress SMTP plugin to route your emails through an external mail server. Many spam filters block emails sent directly from WordPress because spammers often use compromised WordPress websites to send spam email. Using an external SMTP service helps reassure spam filters that your emails are legitimate.
